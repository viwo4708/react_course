                A couple months ago, I ate at the mail dining hall on my campus. I was craving dietary fiber, so I 
                stopped by the salad bar and assembled a culinary conglomeration consisting of kale, spinach, arugula, 
                ranch, hard boiled egg slices, and some other things that escape my memory. I ended up getting food poisoning,
                and vomiting so hard I ruptured blood vessels in my eyeballs and looked baked as hell for like two weeks.
